<p>Welcome All Music Mix regulars, TT refugees, and new users! As always, our core rule is to be nice.</p>

<p>You can find us at <a href="http://plug.dj/everything-mix/">plug.dj/everything-mix/</a></p>

<p>Our rules are pretty simple: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Please keep all videos safe for work *; audio does not need to be censored.</li>
	<li>Please keep all songs under 8 minutes.</li>
	<li>We expect you to treat others as you expect to be treated (aka BE NICE).</li>
</ul>

<p>* We made this rule since many people listen to this site during the day at work. We don't want to get anyone fired because there happens to be a song playing with nudity or sexually explicit content. Please be considerate of this. However, I would hope they are using headphones at work, so the music itself can be as vulgar as you want. :-)</p>
